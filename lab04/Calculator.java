//  The purpose of this program is to provide a user with a basic calculator.
//  It will ask the user for two integers and an operator: +,-,*,/.
//  It will then performe the calculation in the form (a (operator) b).
//
//
//
//  Here we import the scanner class:
import java.util.Scanner;
//  Here we create the class for the program:
public class Calculator
{
//  Here we call the main method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
//  Here we declare necessary variables and initialize the scanner:
        double firstNumber, secondNumber, total;
        String operator;
        Scanner myScanner = new Scanner(System.in);     //This statement initializes a scanner called my scanner, and enables it to accept input from the user.
//
//
//
//  Here we ask the user to input the numbers and operator.
System.out.println("What is the first number?");
firstNumber = myScanner.nextDouble();                   //This statement assigns the number that the user inputs to the variable firstNumber.
System.out.println("What is the second number?");
secondNumber = myScanner.nextDouble();                  //This statement assigns the number that the user inputs to the variable secondNumber.
System.out.println("What operator would you like to use (choose between +,-,*,/?");
operator = myScanner.next();                            //This statement assigns the string that the user inputs to the variable operator.
//
//
//
//  Here we start the switch statement:
        switch (operator)                   //This tells the computer what to do for each of the 4 possible operators, and if the operator that was inputted isn't one of those for, it tells the user that it can't perform the operation.
        {
            case "+":                                               //This case assigns total the value of the sum, and then prints that out.
                {
                    total=firstNumber+secondNumber;
                    System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
                    break;
                }
            case "-":                                               //This case assigns total the value of the difference, and then prints that out.
                {
                    total=firstNumber-secondNumber;
                    System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
                    break;
                }
            case "*":                                               //This case assigns total the value of the multiplication, and then prints that out.
                {
                    total=firstNumber*secondNumber;
                    System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
